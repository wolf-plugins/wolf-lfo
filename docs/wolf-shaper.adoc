*Wolf Shaper* is a waveshaper plugin with a graph editor. It passes the input signal through a function, which you can design using curves. This processing results in a more harmonically rich signal.

== Master parameters
- *Pre* – Controls the input volume, before any processing has taken place. This parameter can be automated for interesting modulation effects.
- *Wet* – Determines the mix between the original and the processed signal in the output. Set this parameter at maximum value to only hear the processed signal.
- *Post* – Controls the output volume, after all processing has been done.
- *Center* – Removes DC offset from the output. This ensures that the resulting waveform is vertically-centerd at zero.
- *Oversample* – Sets the multiple of the sample rate at which the processing will be done. This allows the plugin to filter out some harmonics that would otherwise cause aliasing artifacts.

== Graph controls
- *Uni/Bi switch* – Allows switching between symmetrical and asymmetrical waveshaping. More info coming soon.
- *Reset button* – Puts the graph back at its default state, which is a straight diagonal line. 

== Graph editing
- *Add a vertex* – Right-click in the graph to add a vertex. Keep holding the right mouse button to position the vertex.
- *Move a vertex* – Left-click and drag the vertex.
- *Remove a vertex* – Double left-click on the vertex.
- *Tweak the tension of an edge* – Left-click and drag vertically the tension handle located at the center of the edge.

== User interface
- *Resizing the window* – Left-click and drag the resize handle located at the bottom-right to resize the window. 
- *Config file* – The UI can be customized using a configuration file. More info coming soon.
